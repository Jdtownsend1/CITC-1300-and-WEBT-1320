        <h2>Intro into VR</h2>
            <p>VR can be expensive but it opens a new world to you. You can do things, go places, and experence things you never could in your daily life.</p>
            <p>There are three systems I would recommend and there are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=a_ps&utm_campaign=10876932711&utm_term=oculus&utm_content=496017739373&utm_parent=all&utm_ad=105052990937&utm_location=9013301&utm_location2=&utm_placement=kwd-543294913&utm_adposition=&utm_device=c&utm_matchype=e&utm_feed=&" target="blank">Oculus Rift</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.vive.com/us/" target="blank">HTC Vive</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex" target="blank">Valve Index</a></li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Expectations</h3>
            <p>People expect to jump right into the deep end of the pool and enjoy the world of Ready Player One, we are sadly not there yet. There is still a difference between the worlds, but in time you will adjust and start to feel at home in VR.</p>
