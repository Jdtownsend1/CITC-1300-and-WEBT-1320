                <h1>Dangers of VR</h1>
                <p>There are some very clear dangers to using a VR headset, some of there are minor while others could become more serious. The first problem is of course the nausea that can come from using the system. Your brain and your body will be sending mixed signals the whole time making you feel motion sickness and/or nausea more often at the beginning. The system can also cause eye strain, so it is advised to take breaks and not wear the system for prolonged periods of times. It has been known to cause anxiety in some users depending on what they were exposed to, so be advised, and pay attention to what you expose yourself to. One of the most important things you should do is clear your playing area of all obstructions! Try to clearly mark your area so anyone can tell the safe area vs the dangerous areaâ€™s around you, trust me you cannot see anything around you in there and you might end up punching someone without meaning to.</p>
