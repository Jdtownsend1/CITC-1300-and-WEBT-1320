                <h1>Use's in the real world</h1>
                <p>VR has many potential use’s other than just video games! Back in 2015 googles launched a program to introduce a kit to thousands of schools that allowed them to take their classes on a virtual trip around the world. It has been used by NASA to share with the public the experience of being on board many space vessels. They even discovered through use of the Oculus Rift and the Xbox One’s Kinect 2 sensor, they could control a robotic arm through the operator’s motions and gestures. VR is even being used in the HealthCare system to both train and help with rehabilitation. VR has even made its way to police and military for training purposes, imagine training for a live fire situation without having to wait for it to happen, VR gives them this option! A VR even gives you the option to go for a walk on a beach, relax, meditate, take a load off. The uses of VR are, at this time, limitless! We are only scratching the surface of VR and have far to go!</p>
