                <h1>Intro into VR</h1>
                    <p>VR can be expensive but it opens a new world to you. You can do things, go places, and experence things you never could in your daily life. VR is slowly opening our small worlds up to a much larger world we could never see or live before. Ever wanted to be a fighter poilt before? Not a problem we got a plane sitting on the runway for you right now! Afraid of crashing and burning? Don't worry about it! We'll just hit the reset button and your ready for round two!</p>
                    <p>There are three systems I would recommend and they are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=a_ps&utm_campaign=10876932711&utm_term=oculus&utm_content=496017739373&utm_parent=all&utm_ad=105052990937&utm_location=9013301&utm_location2=&utm_placement=kwd-543294913&utm_adposition=&utm_device=c&utm_matchype=e&utm_feed=&" target="blank">Oculus Rift</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.vive.com/us/" target="blank">HTC Vive</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex" target="blank">Valve Index</a></li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Expectations</h2>
                    <p>People expect to jump right into the deep end of the pool and enjoy the world of Ready Player one, we sadly are not there yet. There is still a difference between the worlds, but in time you will adjust and start to feel at home in VR. Jumping right into the deep end of the pool is dangerous. Your Body needs to adjust before you can dive in for long periods of time.</p>
